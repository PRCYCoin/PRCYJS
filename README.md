Note: You must obtain API info and Server Encryption Key from the DAPS team to be able to access the API. These are placed in the `src/dapslib/config.js`.

Usage
===============
* Create a wallet object from mnemonics
```
const Wallet = require('dapsjs').Wallet;
const config = require('dapsjs').Constants;
var walletObject = new Wallet({mnemonics: mnemonics.mnemonics}, config.DAPS_SERVER, config.DAPSCHAIN, "Bitcoin seed");
```

Once wallet object created, then it will automatically send requests to the RPC server to scan for all transactions belonging to the wallet.

* Get wallet balances: wallet balances are only available (and correct) if and only if the transaction scanning is finished. 
```
function getBalance(wl) {
   if (wl.isScanning) return 'wallet is scanning';
   return {spendable: wl.spendable, immature: wl.immature, pending: wl.pending}
}
```
Note that `wl.isScanning` should be always false, except if the user is logging-in the wallet, which might take from 5 second to 1 minute to finishn scanning, depending whether the user log-in the wallet previously or not.

Wallet will periodically send request to the server every minute to scan for new wallet transactions.

For third-party integration, nothing needs to be done except initialize the wallet object and uses it to show information on the apps of the third-parties.

* Get the current block height: 
```
wl.currentBlockHeight
```

* Create transaction and broadcast it:
```
walletObject.sendTo(destination, amount, function(ret) {
  if (ret.success) {
    state.txCreateResult = {success: true, message: "Successfully create transaction " + ret.txid + " sending " + input.amount + " to " + input.destination};
  } else {
    state.txCreateResult = {success: false, message: "Error:" + ret.reason};
  }
  walletObject.recomputeBalance();
})
```
   ** `destination`: the receiver address
   ** `amount`: amount to send. Amount should be in decimal string

It is worth noting that the wallet object will manage and recompute balances so that third-parties only need to inject the wallet object in their app.

API "sinceblock" Parameter Usage
===============
* Server has already seen the key:
    * sinceBlock = XXX => Server scans from the scanned height stored in the server and return all utxos in block > XXX
* Server has never seen the key:
    * sinceBlock = 0 => Server scans the entire chain and returns all utxos found
    * sinceBlock = XXX => Server scan all blocks > XXX and returns all utxos included in blocks > XXX

If it’s a new wallet, you would only need to set sinceBlock = the currentBlock height => done!

EncryptedViewKey and EncryptedSpendPub
================
* Call getencryptionkey from API to get the public key of the server to encrypt view key and public spend key => EncryptionKey
* Encryption:
    * Generate random r (32 bytes), compute R = r*G
    * Compute ECDH = Hash(r*EncryptionKey)
    * Compute encryptedviewkey = viewkey + ECDH
    * Compute encryptedspendpub
        * X = X of public spend key
        * EncryptedX = X + ECDH
        * encryptedspendpub = EncryptedX|| (03|02)
* Send to server: {method=.., encryptedviewkey=encryptedviewkey, encryptedspendpub=encryptedspendpub, encrypted=true}

Note: `r` in the request sent to server is `R` in the formulae

DAPSJS Statuses / Status Values (currentStatus/currentStatusVal)
================
Statuses have been added to keep the user up to date as to what the wallet is currently doing. Each status also has a corresponding currentStatusVal integer that can be accessed as well.
* Idle - 1 - Starting state
* Scanning - 2 - When the wallet is scanning for UTXOs belonging to a restored phrase
* Processing UTXOs - 3 - Taking the UTXOs that were scanned and processing them all
* Generating transaction history - 4 - Creation of the transaction history from scanned UTXOs
* Recomputing wallet balance - 5 - Recomputing wallet balance
* Complete - 6 - The process is complete
